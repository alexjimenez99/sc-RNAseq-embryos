    "\"To investigate the transitions between healthy and chronically inflamed mucosa, while mitigating patient-specific variability, we collected paired samples from each subject in a single procedure. For UC patients, these were endoscopically assessed as adjacent normal tissue (“non-inflamed”) and inflamed or ulcerated tissue (“inflamed”) (Figure 1A, STAR Methods). To estimate intra-subject variation, we obtained two location-matched samples (distance of ~1–2 cm) from each of the 12 healthy subjects, as well as from both non-inflamed and inflamed regions of 3 UC patients. We then separated the “epithelial” (EPI) and “lamina propria” (LP) fractions from each sample, and performed scRNA-Seq (STAR Methods). We confirmed that expression of an inflammation-associated gene set increased from healthy to non-inflamed to inflamed samples (Figure 1B).\"\n",

    "\"We observed substantial variability between cells that had been obtained from different human subjects, which likely reflects a combination of technical and biological differences. In some cases, these “batch effects” led to cells clustering first by patient or disease phenotype, rather than by cell type or cell state. To eliminate these batch differences, we ran ComBat (Johnson et al., 2007) with default parameters on the log2(TP10K+1) expression matrix, allowing cells to be clustered by cell type or cell state. Importantly, these batch-corrected data were only used for the PCA and all steps relying on PCA (e.g. clustering, diffusion map, t-SNE visualization); all other analyses (e.g. differential expression analysis) were based on the original expression data.\""
