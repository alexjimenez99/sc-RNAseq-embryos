    "For the effect summary, the first column again shows the inferred parameters for all combinations of covariates and cell types. Most important is the distinctions between zero and non-zero entries A value of zero means that no statistically credible effect was detected. For a value other than zero, a credible change was detected. A positive sign indicates an increase, a negative sign a decrease in abundance."
